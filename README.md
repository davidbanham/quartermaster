# Quartermaster

Quartermaster is a web interface for [Field-Marshal](https://github.com/davidbanham/field-marshal)

#Installation

It's just a bunch of static files. Everything is done client-side. Just serve the files and you're good.

Alternately, just use the one hosted here: [http://quartermaster.pinion.gg](http://quartermaster.pinion.gg)
